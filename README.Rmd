## Introduction and Formulated Question

For this project, I chose to focus on Los Angeles City Data, specifically, 'Crime Data in LA from 2020 to present'.  This particular data set documents incidents of crime, transcribed from crime reports.  This data has been provided by the Los Angeles Police Department.  Based on this data set, the question I would like to address is:

What types of crimes have become more prevalent within different LA counties throughout the COVID-19 pandemic?

## Methods

# Reading in the data
```{r}
lacrime <- data.table::fread("crimedata_2020topresent.csv")
```


## Preliminary Results

## Conclusion
